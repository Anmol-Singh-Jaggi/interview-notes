Following topics were very rarely asked from me in my interviews.  
Hence they are **not important**:

# Algo DS:
 - Number-theory (Important for google though)

# Database:
 - Functional dependencies
 - Normalization
 - RAID

# Security:
 - Everything

# Design:
- Low level design patterns are not directly asked but are sometimes very useful for machine coding (design) rounds.

# Networking:
 - Everything

# OS:
 - Disk scheduling
 - Job scheduling
 - Memory management was asked by few startups.
 - Concurrency was asked by a lot of startups, but maybe because it was in my resume, so your mileage may vary.

# DBMS:
 - Was asked by few startups.

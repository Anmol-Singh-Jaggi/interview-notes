# Round 1
- Given an array of arrays like `[[0, 1], [2, 3, 4], [1, 2]]`, generate all tuple combinations like `[0, 2, 1], [0, 2, 2], [0, 3, 1] ... [1, 4, 2]`.

# Round 2
- A hotel is booked but the payment can be done in installments.
- For example, 10% paid when 20 days are left, 30% when 15 days are left , 60% on the day of arrival.
- Design a system to do this. Basically something like a scheduler.

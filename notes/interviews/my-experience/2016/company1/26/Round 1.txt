Q1. You are given two arrays -:

	-	capacity[] -> Representing the capacities of machines
	- weights[] -> Representing the weights of boxes
	
	Each machine takes 1 unit time to load a box and put it on a train.
	Each machine can carry only 1 box at a time. The weight of the box should be <= capacity of the machine it is being loaded on.
	You have to tell the minimum number of time in which we can load all the boxes onto the train.


Solutions -:

Solution 1 -:

Sort both the arrays in decreasing order.
Init ans=0
while weights[] array has some elements -:
	Iterate over the capacity[] array	and check if capacity[i] can store weights[i]; if yes then mark the box as used. When you reach the end of the capacity array, increment ans
	Remove all the used boxes from weights[]

Solution 2 -:

Binary search for the answer.

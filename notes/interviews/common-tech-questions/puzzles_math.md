- Given rand7, generate rand2 and rand5.
- Given rand5, generate rand7.
- You are given 10 boxes with 10 balls each. Every ball weighs 1 kg except the ones in a certain box. Meaning that, say, box 8 might have 10 balls of 2 kg each.
  You can weigh multiple balls at the same time in a weighing machine.

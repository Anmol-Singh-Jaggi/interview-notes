"""
A stable tower of height n is a tower consisting of tiles of various heights stacked vertically in such a way, that no bigger tile is placed on a smaller tile.
We have infinite number of tiles of sizes 1, 2, â€¦, m.

The task is calculate the number of different stable tower of height n that can be built from these tiles, with a restriction that you can use at most k tiles of each size in the tower.

For example:
If n = 3, m = 3 and k = 3, then ans = 3
Possible configurations:
{1, 1, 1}
{2, 1}
{3}

If n=3, m=3 and k=2, then ans = 2
{2, 1}
{3}

Note that this is different from the problem given at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tile-stacking-problem/
I actually read the problem incorrectly haha.

SOLUTION:
Let ans[size][top] be the number of ways to construct a tower of height 'size' with the topmost tile of height 'top'.
Then ans[size][top] = ans[size-top][top] + ans[size-top][top+1] + .... ans[size-top][m]
So we can use DP.
Final answer = ans[n][1] + ans[n][2] + ans[n][3] + .... ans[n][m]

While recursing, we can keep a 'used' hash-map maintaining the current number of tiles used of each height so far.
If at any time, the count becomes greater than k, then straightaway return 0 from there.
Complexity -> O(n*m)

Note that I haven't verified the solution anywhere, since this problem is created by me essentially!

NOTE: This is wrong solution!!

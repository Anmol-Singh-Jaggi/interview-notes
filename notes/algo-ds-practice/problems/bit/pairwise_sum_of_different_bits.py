Given an integer array of n integers, find sum of bit differences in all pairs that can be formed from array elements.
Bit difference of a pair (x, y) is count of different bits at same positions in binary representations of x and y.
For example, bit difference for 2 and 7 is 2.
Binary representation of 2 is 010 and 7 is 111 ( first and last bits differ in two numbers).

Examples :

Input: arr[] = {1, 2}
Output: 4
All pairs in array are (1, 1), (1, 2)
                       (2, 1), (2, 2)
Sum of bit differences = 0 + 2 +
                         2 + 0
                      = 4

Input:  arr[] = {1, 3, 5}
Output: 8
All pairs in array are (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5)
                       (3, 1), (3, 3) (3, 5),
                       (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 5)
Sum of bit differences =  0 + 1 + 1 +
                          1 + 0 + 2 +
                          1 + 2 + 0
                       = 8

SOLUTION:

Assume that all values in input have only 1 bit i.e. Ai = 0 or 1.
Lets say A = count of elements which are 0
and B = count of elements which are 1

In this case our answer is just A*B*2, since each such pair contributes 1 to answer.

Can you combine this logic if we have multiple bits?

Note that all bits are independent in counting, since we are counting number of bits which are different in each pair.
So, we just do the same process for all different bits. Since Ai is an integer, we just have to do this for 31 different bits, so our solution is O(31*N).

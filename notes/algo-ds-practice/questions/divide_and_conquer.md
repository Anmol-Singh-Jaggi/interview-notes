# Divide and Conquer

- Find an element which occurs once among sorted numbers which occur twice each.
- Search an element in a sorted and rotated array.
- Given 2 sorted arrays of different sizes, return the element that would be at index 'k' in the merged array in < O(n).
- Longest substring with atleast k repeating characters -> Fantastic!
- Peak element in sorted array.
- Search in almost sorted array.
- Lower and upper bound.
- Exponential search.
- Ternary search.
- Inversion count.
- Largest rectangle in a histogram.

-----

# Tree

- Height of tree.
- Count leaves.
- Check if 2 trees identical.
- Diameter of tree. -> Anki
- Check if balanced.
- Check if binary tree is a BST.
- Connect nodes at same level.
- Mirror tree.
- Maximum path sum.
- Maximum path sum leaves.
- Views:
  - Left view.
  - Right view.
  - Bottom view.
  - Top view.
- Traversals:
  - Preorder.
  - Postorder.
  - Inorder.
  - Level order.
  - Vertical order.
  - Level order spiral.
  - Diagonal.
  - Boundary.
  - Iterative inorder/preorder/postorder traversals.
  - Morris Traversal and Threaded binary tree.
- Serialization:
  - Using just preorder with Null.
  - Inorder + preorder.
  - Inorder + postorder.
  - Inorder + Level-order.
  - Verify preorder traversal.

- Check if one tree is subtree of another.
- Check if tree is a full binary tree.
- Longest path in undirected tree-graph.
- Check if tree is symmetric.
- Vertex cover for tree.
- Print cousins of a node.
- Check if 2 nodes are cousins.
- Distance between 2 nodes.
- Check if 2 n-ary trees are mirror.
- Check if 2 trees are isomorphic.

# 🏃 Visitor

Real world example

> Consider someone visiting Dubai. They just need a way (i.e. visa) to enter Dubai. After arrival, they can come and visit any place in Dubai on their own without having to ask for permission or to do some leg work in order to visit any place here; just let them know of a place and they can visit it. Visitor pattern lets you do just that, it helps you add places to visit so that they can visit as much as they can without having to do any legwork.

In plain words

> Visitor pattern lets you add further operations to objects without having to modify them.

Wikipedia says

> In object-oriented programming and software engineering, the visitor design pattern is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures. It is one way to follow the open/closed principle.

**Programmatic example**

Let's take an example of a zoo simulation where we have several different kinds of animals and we have to make them Sound. Let's translate this using visitor pattern

```php
// Visitee
interface Animal
{
    public function accept(AnimalOperation $operation);
}

// Visitor
interface AnimalOperation
{
    public function visitMonkey(Monkey $monkey);
    public function visitLion(Lion $lion);
    public function visitDolphin(Dolphin $dolphin);
}
```

Then we have our implementations for the animals

```php
class Monkey implements Animal
{
    public function shout()
    {
        echo 'Ooh oo aa aa!';
    }

    public function accept(AnimalOperation $operation)
    {
        $operation->visitMonkey($this);
    }
}

class Lion implements Animal
{
    public function roar()
    {
        echo 'Roaaar!';
    }

    public function accept(AnimalOperation $operation)
    {
        $operation->visitLion($this);
    }
}

class Dolphin implements Animal
{
    public function speak()
    {
        echo 'Tuut tuttu tuutt!';
    }

    public function accept(AnimalOperation $operation)
    {
        $operation->visitDolphin($this);
    }
}
```

Let's implement our visitor

```php
class Speak implements AnimalOperation
{
    public function visitMonkey(Monkey $monkey)
    {
        $monkey->shout();
    }

    public function visitLion(Lion $lion)
    {
        $lion->roar();
    }

    public function visitDolphin(Dolphin $dolphin)
    {
        $dolphin->speak();
    }
}
```

And then it can be used as

```php
$monkey = new Monkey();
$lion = new Lion();
$dolphin = new Dolphin();

$speak = new Speak();

$monkey->accept($speak);    // Ooh oo aa aa!    
$lion->accept($speak);      // Roaaar!
$dolphin->accept($speak);   // Tuut tutt tuutt!
```

We could have done this simply by having an inheritance hierarchy for the animals but then we would have to modify the animals whenever we would have to add new actions to animals. But now we will not have to change them. For example, let's say we are asked to add the jump behavior to the animals, we can simply add that by creating a new visitor i.e.

```php
class Jump implements AnimalOperation
{
    public function visitMonkey(Monkey $monkey)
    {
        echo 'Jumped 20 feet high! on to the tree!';
    }

    public function visitLion(Lion $lion)
    {
        echo 'Jumped 7 feet! Back on the ground!';
    }

    public function visitDolphin(Dolphin $dolphin)
    {
        echo 'Walked on water a little and disappeared';
    }
}
```

And for the usage

```php
$jump = new Jump();

$monkey->accept($speak);   // Ooh oo aa aa!
$monkey->accept($jump);    // Jumped 20 feet high! on to the tree!

$lion->accept($speak);     // Roaaar!
$lion->accept($jump);      // Jumped 7 feet! Back on the ground!

$dolphin->accept($speak);  // Tuut tutt tuutt!
$dolphin->accept($jump);   // Walked on water a little and disappeared
```

# Zookeeper
- Helps in managing a distributed multi server-client system.
- Its basically a distributed key-value store.
- Helps in handling the mechanics of clustering -- heartbeats, distributing updates/configuration, distributed locks, etc.
- Data is distributed between multiple nodes (this set of nodes is called an "ensemble") and one client connects to any of them (i.e., a specific "server"), migrating if one node fails.
- All the writes go to the leader which replicates it to follower servers.
- Read can be done from any servers.
- ZooKeeper offers the library to construct your synchronization primitives, while the ability to run a distributed server avoids the single-point-of-failure issue you have when using a centralized (broker-like) message repository.
- ZooKeeper is feature-light, meaning that mechanisms such as leader election, locks, barriers, etc. are not already present, but can be written above the ZooKeeper primitives.
- In particular, a master node is dynamically chosen by consensus within the ensemble; if the master node fails, the role of master migrates to another node. 
- Provides automatic node naming.
- Provides consistency and partition tolerance.
- Things you can implement using Zookeeper:
 - Queues.
 - Locks.
 - 2-Phase Commit.
 - Leader election.
 - Automatic service discovery.

- Zookeeper servers and kafka servers can be the same, however it is recommended to have separate dedicated machines for zookeeper (since its I/O and memory intensive).

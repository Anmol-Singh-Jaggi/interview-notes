Example of data-driven design:

in Netflix, the header image of a movie is selected based on experiments.
Lets say  image1, image2, image3 are contenders.
And when image2 is selected, the video gets seen the most times.
So image2 is winner

Improvments:

Lets say a user likes comedy, then for all the movies that are recommended to him, the image headers will be chosen such that they depict comedy in some way.

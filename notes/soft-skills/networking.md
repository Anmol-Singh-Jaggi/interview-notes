## Asking for referrals on Linkedin

Hello <<>>, hope you are doing well.
Thanks for accepting my invitation to connect.
I have been thinking of pursuing other career options in the tech sector.
I would love to explore opportunities in <>> as a <<>>.
Will it be possible to get a referral?

To quickly brief you about my profile, I am working in Infosys as a Specialist Programmer since the last 3.5 years.
Before that I completed my undergrad in Computer Science in 2016 from Delhi College of Engineering.
I am passionate about problem-solving and algorithms.
I have mostly worked as a backend developer on an AI and automation platform with primary focus on design, solving highly complex problems, adding new features and scaling the existing ones using concurrency and optimized algorithms.
My daily aim is to listen and learn something new.

Please let me know if you think my profile will match any requirements that you may be aware of apart from the role I mentioned.
Also, feel free to let me know if I could be of any help to you.

Attaching my resume for reference.

Thank you,
Anmol

## Referrals
- Treat it as a sales funnel.
- Lets say you want to join company X.
- Send a connection request to 20 people from company X.
- Out of 20, lets say 15 will accept request.
- Send the above referral pitch to all of them.
- Out of 15, maybe 5 will accept.
- Out of the 5 referrals, you'll atleast get 1-2 job interviews.
- Note that since referrals are supposed to be given to the people you know.
- Since you are a stranger, do them a favour and prepare **WELL** for the interview to not waste the referral.

## What distinguishes a great software engineer from a good one?
- A great software engineer has a healthy balance between perfectionism and pragmatism.
- Too often engineers want their code to be perfect, while losing sight of the overall goals of the project.
- A great programmer also learns not to fall in love with their own code, to keep a healthy skepticism until it's been thoroughly tested, making sure it is the right choice for the project at hand.
- And yes, I believe have the qualities of a great programmer, though working on my need to be perfect is an ongoing battle.

## In your opinion, what are the principles of good software engineering? What are some basic principles everyone should follow?
- I think one of the main principles of software engineering, and one I try to live by, is to keep things as simple as possible.
- You're often already dealing with complex algorithms and design concerns, so no need to make things even more difficult with overly complicated, resource-heavy code. Your code should be simple, lean and easy to read.
- If you start there, the rest will follow.

## Why should we hire you?
- Because why not :D

## Questions for the manager
A few things to look for to see if its a good manager:  
- **Empathy**: Tell them a difficult personal story, see how they react and respond.
- **Passion**: Ask them what they are most excited about for their team, see if their eyes light up.
- **Perseverance**: Ask about what struggles their team had to overcome and how they helped.
- **Technical**: Ask details about the subject matter they work on. Get really into the nitty gritty details.
- **Unopinionated/Humble**. Challenge something they state, say you think it should go a different way. See if they're willing to listen to you, and backing their claims with evidence.
- **Retention**. Ask about the last time someone wanted to leave their team. Why did they want to leave, and what they did. Did they support their decision?

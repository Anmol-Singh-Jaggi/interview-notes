# Java concurrency
- The difference between `thenApply()` vs `thenApplySync()` is that the latter is executed on a different thread pool.
- The difference between `Future` and `CompletableFuture` is that the latter is similar to a `Promise` and can be used to compose async tasks.
- The difference between `thenAccept()` and `thenApply()` is that the former always returns a `Future<Void>`.
- The difference between `thenApply()` and `thenCompose()` is that the former acts as `map()` and the latter acts as `flatMap()`.

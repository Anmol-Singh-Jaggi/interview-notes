- Note that in all the synchronization problems, we can ofcourse implement them in a crude way by using a plain mutex over the entire data structure.
- Thus converting it into plain old mutual-exclusion / critical-section problem.
- But that wont achieve stability and defeats the purpose of using multithreading as only 1 thread will be active at one time.
- Hence, we need to ensure minimal code to be covered within locks for the least amount of time.
- That is the locking should be as *fine-grained* as possible.
- The lock should hold the minimum possible data for the minimum possible time.
